# Business Churn Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting customer churn for businesses using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service, enabling businesses to effectively intervene and reduce churn rates.

## Project Overview

Churn prediction is a common challenge across many industries, particularly those with subscription-based business models. This project builds a predictive model to classify customers into "churn" and "non-churn" categories based on available data, such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and transaction history.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model development (classification)
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of important features and predictions

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   cd business_churn_prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Place your data files in the `data/` directory.
- Run exploratory and model analysis via Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
- Scripts in `src/` can be used for reproducible preprocessing and model training.
